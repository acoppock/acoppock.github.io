Graeme Blair, Jasper Cooper, Alexander Coppock, Macartan Humphreys, Neal Fultz. 2019. <b>DeclareDesign: Declare and Diagnose Research Designs</b>. R package version 0.23.0.

# Abstract
Researchers can characterize and learn about the properties of research designs before implementation using `DeclareDesign`. Ex ante declaration and diagnosis of designs can help researchers clarify the strengths and limitations of their designs and to improve their properties, and can help readers evaluate a research strategy prior to implementation and without access to results. It can also make it easier for designs to be shared, replicated, and critiqued.
