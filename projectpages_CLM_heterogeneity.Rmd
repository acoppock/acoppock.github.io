## Abstract

Abstract: The extent to which studies conducted with non-representative convenience samples are generalizable to broader populations depends critically on the level of treatment effect heterogeneity. Recent inquiries (e.g., Mullinix et al. 2015; Coppock forthcoming) have found a strong correspondence between average treatment effects estimated in nationally-representative experiments and in replication studies conducted with convenience samples. In this paper, we consider three possible explanations: low levels of effect heterogeneity, high levels of effect heterogeneity that are unrelated to selection into the convenience sample, or just good luck. We reanalyze 26 original-replication study pairs (encompassing 98,425 individual survey responses) to assess the extent to which a model of heterogeneity in treatment response estimated on the original dataset predicts the heterogeneity in the replication experiment, and vice-versa. While there are exceptions, the overwhelming pattern that emerges is one of treatment effect homogeneity, providing a partial explanation for strong correspondence across both unconditional and conditional average treatment effect estimates.
