# Abstract
Using a novel field experimental design, we rigorously tested the effectiveness of an online banner ad in changing political attitudes. We find that attitudes towards the blacklivesmatter campaign's issues were unaffected by a week's worth of exposure ads. This null result cannot be attributed to small sample sizes or noisy outcome measures: Our experiment was powerful enough to detect even small changes in attitudes.
